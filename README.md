# User Management App

This is a small React project I built to manage users in a clean and organized way. It demonstrates React, Redux, and Ant Design working together. The app fetches user data from a public API and lets me add, update, delete, and view user details—all in one place.


# Tools & Why I Used Them
* React – For building the frontend with reusable components.
* Redux – For state management, keeping the app fast and organized.
* Ant Design – For clean tables, forms, and buttons with professional styling.
* Axios – To fetch user data from JSONPlaceholder.
* React Router – To navigate to user details pages.


# Features
### List Users
Fetch and display users in a table with name, email, and company.
### Search
Quickly find a user by name or email.
### User Details
Click a user to see address, phone, website, and company info.
### Add, Update & Delete
Add new users (name and email required).
Update or delete users locally using Redux.
### Sorting
Sort by Name, Email, or Company ascending/descending.


How to Run

This project shows how React, Redux, and Ant Design can be combined to build a real-world user management app. It’s fully interactive, maintains clean code, and demonstrates practical state management and responsive UI design.
